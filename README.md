# Exercise Tracker

## Description : 
The Exercise Tracker is a simple web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that allows users to track their exercises and create custom workout plans. This project was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs certification.

The application provides REST API endpoints to create and retrieve exercises and users data, and uses Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to interact with the MongoDB database. The API endpoints include user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), error handling, and data validation.

The front-end interface is built with Bootstrap and jQuery, and allows users to create, update, and delete exercises and view their workout logs. The UI also includes charts powered by Chart.js to visualize the user's progress over time.

This application can be used as a template or reference for building similar web applications with Node.js and MongoDB, and can be deployed to platforms like Heroku or Glitch.

Feel free to use this project as a learning resource or as a starting point for your own fitness tracking projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
